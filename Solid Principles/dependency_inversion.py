Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

DIP states:
High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules.
Both should depend on abstractions.

This example first demonstrates the *problem* of tight coupling 
between high-level and low-level modules, and then shows the 
*solution* using abstractions.

# --------------------------
# Explanation
# --------------------------

# All the implementation above works, but the first version has a serious problem:
# It is tightly coupled with the low-level module.
#
# If we want to change the way we store relationships, we will have to change the 
# high-level module as well.
#
# This happens because the high-level module is directly accessing the internal 
# storage mechanism of the low-level module.
#
# --------------------------
# How to tackle this situation?
# --------------------------
#
# First, we define an interface (or abstract base class) for the low-level module.
#
# The idea is that Research should not depend on the concrete implementation 
# of Relationships, but instead on an abstraction that can be swapped out later.
#
# --------------------------
# Dependency Inversion Principle
# --------------------------
#
# The DIP is different from Dependency Injection.
#
# DIP states that high-level classes or modules should not directly depend on
# low-level modules â€” they should depend on **abstractions**.
#
# In Python, these abstractions are typically abstract base classes 
# or classes with abstract methods.
#
# In short: you should depend on interfaces rather than concrete implementations.
# This way, you can swap one implementation for another without affecting the high-level logic.
#
# The second example demonstrates this:
# - RelationshipBrowser is the abstraction
# - RelationshipV2 implements it
# - ResearchV2 depends only on the abstraction
