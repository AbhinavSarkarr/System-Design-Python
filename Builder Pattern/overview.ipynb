    "Some objects are simple and can be created with a single initializer call.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Other objects, however, require a lot of setup and need to be built in stages.  \n",
    "When an object requires many initializer arguments (e.g., 10 or more), it becomes hard to use and maintain.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of making one large initializer call, we use **piecewise construction**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "With this approach, we call different methods of a special component called a **Builder**,  \n",
    "which provides an API to construct the object step by step.  \n",

    "# 🏗️ Builder Pattern — Why, What, and How\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔴 The Pain Point (Problem)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Some objects are **easy**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "  user = User(\"Alice\", 25)  # simple, readable\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "* But some objects are **hard**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * They have **many parameters** (10+).\n",
    "  * Some parameters may be **optional**.\n",
    "  * The constructor call becomes **ugly and unreadable**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "car = Car(\"BMW\", \"X5\", \"Black\", \"Automatic\", \"Diesel\", 2025, True, False, 5, \"Luxury\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* You (or your teammate) won’t remember what each argument means.\n",
    "* Mistakes happen easily if arguments are in the wrong order.\n",
    "* Adding **optional fields** makes the constructor messier.\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 **This is the pain point.**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🟢 What is a Builder?\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **separate component (class)** that provides an **API** to build an object **step by step**.\n",
    "* Instead of one huge constructor call, you **configure the object gradually**.\n",
    "* At the end, you call `.build()` to get the final object.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔧 How They Are Used\n",
    "\n",
    "Example with a **Builder**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "car = (CarBuilder()\n",
    "       .set_brand(\"BMW\")\n",
    "       .set_model(\"X5\")\n",
    "       .set_color(\"Black\")\n",
    "       .set_transmission(\"Automatic\")\n",
    "       .set_engine(\"Diesel\")\n",
    "       .set_year(2025)\n",
    "       .set_seats(5)\n",
    "       .build())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Much more **readable** — you know what each value means.\n",
    "✅ You can **skip optional fields**.\n",
    "✅ Easy to **extend** later without breaking code.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 The Exact Reason They Are Used For\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Readability**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Replace unreadable constructor calls with clear step-by-step method calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Maintainability**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * If tomorrow you add a new property (`.add_sunroof()`), you don’t break existing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Flexibility**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * You can provide **fluent APIs** (method chaining).\n",
    "   * You can build **different variants** of the same object easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Encapsulation of Complexity**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * All the messy initialization logic is hidden inside the **Builder**, not in the client code.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📝 In One Line\n",
